# 389. Find the Difference

## Problem Description

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```python
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
```

**Output:**
```python
"e"
```

**Explanation:**
'e' is the letter that was added.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```python
s = ""
t = "y"
```

**Output:**
```python
"y"
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
