# 242. Valid Anagram

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```python
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"
```

**Output:**
```python
true
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```python
s = "rat"
t = "car"
```

**Output:**
```python
false
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Follow-up

**What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?**
